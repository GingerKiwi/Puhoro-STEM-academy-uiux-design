This repo showcases the Adobe Xd design files and relevant links from the project.

Pūhoro STEM Academy needed to make their onsite bilingual te reo Māori/English activities accessible to classes all over New Zealand. The project required knowledge of Māori culture and language. This was the major project for my grad course in UX Design at Massey University, New Zealand (online from Toronto, Canada).

Our group of five chose one activity to design a student and teacher dashboard for. We worked remotely, spread over three countries, and three time zones during the pandemic. During the project time group members experienced two natural disasters, one member's toddler being admitted to hospital, another member having a major injury, and someone else moving internationally back to New Zealand and being in long-term quaratine. I was the lead on the visualization part of the project and taught myself and another group member Adobe Xd. We finished on time and earned an A- grade.
